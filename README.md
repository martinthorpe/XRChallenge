# XR Games Developer Challenge

## Brief
The purpose of this test is to evaluate the candidate’s ability in programming, use of Unity, skill with Git and appetite for making games.

## Mission
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to create a very simple game. This involves player control of an avatar from a top down perspective, collecting stars and reaching an exit. We have made a start for you. After cloning the repository, open up the **Main.unity** scene and get started!

The objectives should take you about 1-3 hours. You may, however, spend as much time as you wish within the boundary of the deadline to embellish your demo. The deadline is **1 week** from receipt of this document.

### Objectives
* Implement simple character movement using WASD;
* Implement a pickup system that adds points when a star is collected;
* Display the player's total score on the GUI;
* You should place at least 5 pickups in a level;
* Add boundaries so the player is restricted to the level;
* After all the pickups in the level have been collected, the game can be completed by entering a finish zone;
* Entering a finish zone before all the pickups are collected should not complete the game;
* Demonstrate good use of git.

### Restrictions
* You must use the **Pickup** class provided and you **CANNOT** edit it;
* You may use third party assets (e.g. from the asset store). However, all the code **MUST** be yours.

### Embellishments
Feel free to embellish your game within the time allowed. Below are some examples, but you can implement anything you want. This is your chance to impress us -- get creative!

* A full game loop. i.e. Start → Play → Win/Lose → Restart
* Enemies/Hazards and death state.
* Animations, visual feedbacks, additional GUI elements.
* Character actions e.g. Jumping.
* Controllers (i.e. Xbox, DualShock, etc.) support.
* Some basic audio.

## Submission
To submit the challenge, reply to the email you received this in. In the email please include the following:

1. Attached zip file of the project, including local git history.
1. A concise, bullet point list of the features implemented.
1. A list of proposed improvements that you would make, if you were to continue development of the game.
1. Any other comments and thoughts you have about this challenge.

Please submit the above **within 1 week** of receipt of this document. If you’re unable to complete the task within that time frame due to prior commitments, please contact us.

***Please enjoy this mission!***
